68000 Disassembler:

    These files provide a simple 68000 disassembler.  The program "disassem"
will read standard DOS object files, and disassemble the code sections. 
Data sections are dumped in hex, symbol definitions are listed appropriately.
My main interest was in dumping executable files, so I haven't integrated
the symbols with the disassembled code.  The file "convert.c" is the 
procedure which actually converts a single instruction to a text string.  If
you want to disassemble information in memory, or from some other object
file format it should be easy to change the disassem program.  The 
disassembler will convert any valid instruction to text, it will not however
notice all invalid combinations of addressing modes.  Thus, some invalid
instruction codes may be printed as valid.  Main other problem with the
program is that it can't be stopped, needs to notice control C, or the like.
You may copy-change-use this program as you like.

Note: The control-C problem has been solved by using a Beta 3.04 version
of Lattice C, which has control-C break enabled as the default.

I have found this disassembler useful on a number of occasions, so it is
included in the PDC Software Distribution release 3.3.  Unfortunately,
it is coded using bitfields so PDC cannot compile it.
