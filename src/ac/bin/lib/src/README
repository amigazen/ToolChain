The amiga.lib in the lib directory on this disk was generated using the
Makefile contained here.  If you find yourself needing to reconstruct
amiga.lib for yourself, this is the place to start.  Amiga.lib can be
regenerated by simply typing "make".  If you want to reconstruct amiga.lib
with ALL of the additional functions in this directory, you'll need the
standard Amiga includes as well.  Use "make complete" to also build in
these extra functions.
