Each program in the PDC Distribution is covered by its own copyright and
distribution restrictions.  Some material in the collection is freely 
distributable, other material is public domain.  It is your obligation to
obey the author's expressed wishes if described so in the source, documentation,
or when running the program.

Many programs come with their own docuentation.  All except "ccx" and "PDC"
are available elsewhere and hence if you can't find the docs in this beta
release, you can always go back to the original source (usually a Fish disk).

----------

CCX -	executable on Program Disk
	source on Libs/Utils Source disk

A UNIX-like frontend to the compiler/assembler/linker.  Since AmigaDOS scripts
are...well...not as functional as UNIX shell scripts, this one is written in C.

----------

PDC - 	executable on Program Disk
	Source on PDC/A68k Source disk.

Dis is da compiler, you lunkhead!  Whaddya think it is, Swiss cheese?  (Please
don't answer that question;-)

----------

A68k -	executable on Program Disk
	Source on PDC/A68k Source disk.

This is Charlie Gibbs' assembler version 2.6.  It is distributed in unmodified
form, without changes or additional documentation.

----------

BLink - executable on Program Disk.  Shareware from The Software Distillery

This is the linker we're currently distributing.  We included version 6.7 from 
a Fish disk.  Alink compatible.

----------

Bind -	executable on Program Disk
	source on Libs/Utils Source disk

Bind will take the .fd files that came on the Extras disk with your Amiga and
generate a stub file that you should link with to access the Amiga's shared
libraries.

----------

Make -	executable on Program Disk
	source on Libs/Utils Source disk

A PD Make utiltiy ported from comp.sources.unix

----------

Libr -  executable on Program Disk
	source on Libs/Utils Source disk

An object-module librarian.

----------

Dasm -	executable on Program Disk
	source on Libs/Utils Source disk

This is a rather useful little disassembler.  Although the existing source is
an example of code that can not be compiled by PDC because it is littered with
bit fields.
