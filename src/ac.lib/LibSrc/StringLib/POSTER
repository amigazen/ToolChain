[  This is an update of the string library Henry posted to net.sources
   some time ago.  It is different from a recent library published in
   volume 4 in these two respects:
	1. It comes with a fairly exhaustive test program, which it passes.
	2. It does not invent new functions; it implements the union of those
	   described in X3J11, the SVID, etc., and nothing else.
   It would be nice if everyone -- vendors, users -- put the "missing"
   functions into their C library, and we could all live in harmony,
   but I suspect that's wishful thinking.  (Yeah, yeah:  efficiency, too.)
   This is also excempted from my mandatory manpage requirement, for
   reasons mentioned and alluded to in the second paragraph of the README
   file.  --r$ ]
