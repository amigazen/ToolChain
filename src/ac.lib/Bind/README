Bind, written by Bill Barton, takes a standard .fd (function definition) 
file and generates a binding library for the functions defined in the 
.fd file. The bindings are generated based on a set of rules for a 
target compiler defined in a file called "bindfile".  These rules 
specifiy which registers need to be preserved, how the arguments 
are passed on the stack, and the syntax to call an assembler and 
a librarian.  It is anticipated that this program will be of great
use to those hacking on redistributable C compilers such as PD C
and gcc.

We apologise to everyone who does not have an Amiga for the binary nature
of this posting, but this program seems so incredibly useful to Amiga
developers that we feel it's worth making an exception for.
