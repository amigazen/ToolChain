Rules.c: many of the default program names were turned into symbols and given
default values.  This allows greater customization of the defaults at runtime.
I changed the compiled-in defaults to fit with PDC.

Corrected bug in reader.c whereby the last line of a Makefile causes an error
when the line doesn't end with a '\n'.
