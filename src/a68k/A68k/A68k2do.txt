A68k - things to do as of January 11, 1990


*** BUGS ***

(There are no known bugs at this time.)


*** ENHANCEMENTS ***

Implement an ARexx interface to an editor (e.g. CED) for debugging.

Improve the small code / small data option - study linker documentation!

Wild optimizations? (e.g. MOVE.W #0,D0 -> CLR.W D0)
                    (MOVE.L #16,D0 -> MOVE.W #16,D0 -> MOVEQ #16,D0)

Treat (An,Dn) as 0(An,Dn)?  Or just leave for 68020 upgrade?

Add 68010/68020 support.
